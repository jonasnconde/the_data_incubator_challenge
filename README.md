Diabetes is a group of desorders characterized by chronic high blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia, due to the body's inability to produce any or enough insulin to regulate high glucose levels. The impact of diabetes is greater than hyperglycemia, being a leading cause of blindness, kidney diseases, and non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. Diabetes and its related complications result in an estimated 200,000+ deaths each year, making diabetes one of the major causes of mortality in the U.S.

Several risk factors such as age, race, pregnancy, stress, certain medications, high cholesterol and obesity has already been described. The single best predictor of type 2 diabetes is overweight or obesity. Almost 90% of people living with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity. The number of diabetes cases among American adults increased by a third during the 1990s, and additional increases are expected. This rapid increase in the occurrence of diabetes is mostly attributed to the growing prevalence of obesity in the United States.

As diabetes and obesity are strong correlated with each other, this brings us a big question: what other factors strong correlate with the development of diabetes and obesity? To answer this, I choose the Food Environment Atlas data set from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which has over 275 variables covering almost all counties of all states from U.S. Is the average household income correlated with the development of diabetes and obesity? Are poverty and child poverty important factors? Are the national assistance programs important?
